# Vypr Compiler

## Overview
Vypr is a lightweight and expressive programming language designed to provide a Python-like experience with a more concise and structured syntax. The goal of Vypr is to simplify coding by reducing syntactic overhead while maintaining readability and flexibility. 

Vypr's syntax is inspired by Python but introduces its own set of keywords and rules for defining variables, control structures, and functions. Instead of executing code directly, Vypr compiles into Python, allowing for seamless integration with Python's ecosystem while offering an alternative syntax that some developers may find more intuitive.

The Vypr compiler consists of several stages:
- **Lexical Analysis**: Converts source code into tokens.
- **Parsing**: Constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from tokens.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Ensures correctness by detecting undeclared variables and type inconsistencies.
- **Intermediate Representation (IR)**: Translates AST into a lower-level, structured format for easier code generation.
- **Code Generation**: Produces Python code, which can be executed as a standalone script.

## Features
- **Lightweight Syntax**: Reduces boilerplate while maintaining clarity.
- **Python-Compatible**: Generates Python code for execution.
- **Structured Language**: Supports variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **Flexible Semantics**: Allows intuitive program flow with indentation-based scoping.

## File Structure
- `lexer.py` - Tokenizes source code into tokens.
- `parser.py` - Parses tokens into an AST.
- `semantic_analyzer.py` - Performs semantic checks.
- `ir_generator.py` - Converts AST into IR instructions.
- `code_generator.py` - Generates Python code from IR.
- `compiler.py` - Main compiler pipeline.
- `test.py` - Example usage of the compiler.

## Supported Syntax
### Variable Declaration
```plaintext
var x = 10
var name = "Alice"
```

### Conditional Statements
```plaintext
if x > 5:
    print "x is greater than 5"
else:
    print "x is 5 or less"
```

### Loops
```plaintext
loop while x > 0:
    print x
    x = x - 1
```

### Functions
```plaintext
func greet(name):
    print "Hello, " + name

greet("Alice")
```

## Running the Compiler
To compile and generate Python code from a source program:
```python
from compiler import Compiler

source_code = """
var sum = 5 + 3
print sum  // Outputs: 8
"""

compiler = Compiler()
output_code = compiler.compile(source_code, "output.py")
print(output_code)
```

## Output
This will generate a Python file (`output.py`) that executes the equivalent program in Python.
